# Async Python Web Apps with WebSockets Demo Code
Example code for my live coded demo at the January 2015
[SF Python meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/219577721/) 
and updated for
[Django District](http://www.meetup.com/django-district/events/220439364/) 
in March 2015.

Note: I ran this demo with gunicorn behind an 
[Nginx](https://www.fullstackpython.com/nginx.html) reverse proxy with
the appropriate WebSocket configuraiton .conf file. There can be issues
upgrading the connection via the local Flask development server.

Watch the [live-coded demo video for full effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5YQbNrFfyw). The [slides are available](http://www.mattmakai.com/presentations/2015-sfpython-websockets.html)
but fair warning, they won't make much sense without corresponding audio/video.

This talk goes along with the 
[Full Stack Python WebSockets page](http://www.fullstackpython.com/websockets.html)
and
[Resources for WebSockets with Python](http://www.mattmakai.com/websockets-python-resources.html) 
blog post.
